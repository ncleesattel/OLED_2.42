## OLED 242 pcb
This is an alternative pcb to the one provided by DIYmore.
A key difference is that no smd soldering is necessary to switch from SPI mode to I2C mode.
Instead there is a switch pad that can be used.

I use this pcb to connect 2.42 inch displays from Aliexpress to either my SHC build or the ESP32 dew heater.
Look for 2.42" 128x64 SSD1309 displays and the assoc. metal frame.

## ordering
The pcb is designed in KiCad.  
In the jlcpcb folder you can find the Gerber, BOM and CPL file you need to not only order the pcb, but also the assembled smd parts.

## cost estimate
| Item | Number | Cost |
|------|--------|------|
| pcb | 5 | 60 |
| frame | 5 | 13 |
| display | 5 | 52 |

Best case you can use all displays equals to 25/unit.  
Worst case you just need one and can't share the cost of the other four equals to 125.
